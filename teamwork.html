        Hi dear friends! 🌟<br />
          Welcome to your first teamwork assignment! 🎉 <br />
           I want you to collaboratively build a website incorporating all the things you've learned so far. 🌐 <br />
            While working on your website, please follow these instructions to ensure a well-rounded project: <br />
             1.Each page should include a form, a table, and a list as a minimum requirement. 📝🗒📋 <br />
              2.Once you decide on the content of your website, each team member should take responsibility for building one page individually. 🚧👩‍💻👨‍💻 <br />
               3.One team member should be in charge of creating the repository. Each team member should then create their own branches with their names based on the main branch of that repository. 🌿🌳 <br />
                4.Throughout the website creation process, every team member must send at least 4 pull requests in their respective branches to contribute effectively. 📨🔀 <br />
                 5.Finally, remember to share the repository address and some screenshots of your completed website. 📎📸 <br />
                  And most importantly, don't forget to have fun! ❤️😉 Using CSS is strictly forbidden in this task.
